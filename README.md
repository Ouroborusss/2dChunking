# 2dChunking
A 2d chunking algorithm which takes in a CSV containing coordinates and uses chunking to find nearest neighbors.

The top of the main file contains editable parameters.
Warning, the chunking can take time and will slow down the computer if over used. The search will still be very fast.

Prerequisite packages include time, math, pandas, numpy, and tqdm.
